# ats-resume-optimizer

Optimize resumes for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) by analyzing job descriptions and tailoring resume content with relevant keywords while preserving original structure, length, and bullet point counts. Use when Claude needs to: (1) help users tailor their resume for specific job applications, (2) improve resume keyword matching for ATS systems, or (3) generate ATS-compatible resume formats in both JSON and document outputs.
